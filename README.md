# Lexical Highlighter
This project consists of a C++ program that behaves like a finite-state machine using a state table (`stateTable.csv`) that highlights an input text file (`scheme.txt`) according to the tokens of the Scheme programming language. All these files can me found inside of `/mainCode`. The program exports an HTML file where the code is highlighted using CSS.
